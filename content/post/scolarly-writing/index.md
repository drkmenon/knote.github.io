This is all you have to know for your platform independent academic writing. 
{{% /callout %}}

Scholarly writing is a necessary requirement for any one in Academia. There are many ways to do this. Many people use multiple software  to complete their writing using computers. Most of them use anyone or the combination of the following list of **"traditional word processors"**, which of course is not an exhaustive list.

+ `Microsoft office` 
+ `Libreoffice`
+ `LaTEX, lyx`
+ `Scrivener, Ullysses`
+ `Markdown softwares like adam`
+ `pages`
+ `google docs`


The exchange of documents and conversion to different formats is a problem with these software. 

I tried a lot of tools for education and scientific writing. I started off with Microsoft office. Later on I used scrivener and lyx for some time. This introduced me to Markdown and I started using `drafts` a lot.

Amount of time spent in finding a proper workflow, converting them to different formats, storing them without getting lost and last but not the least, the **version control** made me search and search and I finally found out a very efficient work flow. This workflow basically covers everything I need to do with my writing in one go, that too using a single open-source environment.

## Following are the requirements:
1. I use a `MacBook Air`
2. `r and RStudio`
3. xQuartz
4. `pandoc`
5. `Zotero` and `Better Bibtex`
6. `GitHub` account
7. `Netlify` account

With this workflow ***you donot have to `first` think which output format you want.***
